      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>There's not much to know about me I'm just your average person. </p>

      <p>I have been a professional gamer for the past 7 years. I have a 12 year old german shorthaired pointer who is
        the best dog ever. I canoe as much as possible and I live in the gym.</p>

      <p>Being part of the tech industry has been a huge passion of mine since highschool and I can't wait to see where
        it takes me!</p>
